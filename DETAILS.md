# timpi-cise — technical reference

Full detail on every mode, setting, metric, and endpoint. For a plain-English
overview and install steps, see the [README](README.md).

## Command-line flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--config <path>` | per-user config dir | Config file (created if missing). |
| `--addr <host:port>` | `127.0.0.1:8770` | Dashboard listen address (loopback). |
| `--no-open` | off | Don't auto-open a browser. |
| `--start` | off | Begin polling immediately on launch. |
| `--verbose` | off | Log at debug level. |
| `--expose` | off | Allow non-loopback (LAN) access (disables the DNS-rebinding guard). |
| `--version` | — | Print version and exit. |

## Connection modes

| Mode | What it does | Needs |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **dry-run** (default) | Generates queries and drives the whole pipeline with **no network activity**. | nothing |
| **browser** | Drives the real `timpi.com` UI in a headless browser and scrapes the rendered results. The faithful way to exercise timpi.com. | an installed Chrome/Edge/Chromium |
| **public-web** | Hits a REST/JSON search endpoint over plain HTTP. | a REST endpoint |
| **official-api** | Uses an authenticated Timpi Data API endpoint. | endpoint URL + API key |

### Why browser mode exists

`timpi.com` is a **Blazor Server** app — its search runs client-side over a
SignalR WebSocket, so there is no REST endpoint that returns JSON. Browser mode
launches an installed **Chrome/Edge/Chromium** (auto-detected; override with a
path), navigates to `https://timpi.com/search?q={query}`, dismisses the cookie
banner, waits for results to render, and scrapes them. Defaults target
timpi.com's DOM (`.all-item-content` / `a.title` / `.description`); every
selector is editable for other sites. It's heavier (~a few seconds/query) but is
the only way to get **real** results from a client-rendered search site. The
1-query/minute floor still applies; the browser is not bundled.

### public-web / official-api

Put the URL in **Endpoint URL** (use `{query}` for the term, or set a **Query
param** like `q`) and a **Results JSON path** (e.g. `data.results`) plus the
title/url/snippet field names. If an endpoint returns HTML instead of JSON, the
app shows an honest "returned an HTML page, not JSON results" note rather than
faking success. The official-api key is stored locally and never sent to the
browser.

## Query sources

### Built-in generator

- **realistic** — curated corpus of real-world queries across navigational /
  informational / transactional / local intents, sampled head-weighted
  (Zipfian-like) so common queries recur and the long tail stays diverse.
- **terms / phrases / questions** — short terms, multi-word phrases, or
  natural-language questions.
- **mixed** — rotates through terms, phrases, and questions.

### Your own CSV term list

Upload a `.csv`/`.txt` file (one query per line). Optional 2nd column sets the
kind (`terms`/`phrases`/`questions`); optional 3rd column is a **golden-query**
substring a result must contain:

```csv
timpi,terms,timpi.io
best budget laptop,phrases,
how does search indexing work?,questions,
```

### Optional model server (local GPU or remote)

Have a model generate queries via **Ollama** or any **OpenAI-compatible** server
(LM Studio, llama.cpp, Jan, LocalAI, vLLM, text-generation-webui, or a hosted
API). Choose per type — short terms / long phrases / questions — whether it comes
from the model or the built-in CPU generator. If the server is unreachable, every
type falls back to CPU. No model is bundled.

**Picking a model.** The tool polls your server for the models it has available
(Ollama's `/api/tags` or the OpenAI-compatible `/models`, via `POST
/api/llm/models`) and shows them in a **dropdown**, so you select rather than
type. It refreshes automatically when you enable the server, switch the provider,
or change the base URL — or on demand via **Fetch installed models**. Wrong
settings produce a clear inline message rather than an empty list.

**LM Studio:** choose the **OpenAI-compatible** provider and a base URL ending in
`/v1` (e.g. `http://localhost:1234/v1`), and make sure the model is **loaded** in
LM Studio (the server only serves loaded models).

**Reasoning models** (qwen3, deepseek-r1, etc.) work but are slower: they spend
hundreds of hidden "thinking" tokens before answering, so the generation token
budget is sized generously to let them finish (a small budget makes them return
empty output). For faster, lighter generation, load a small **instruct** model.
An embeddings-only model can be listed but cannot generate text.

## Assertions & golden queries (monitor mode)

- **Global assertions**: fail a query if it errors, returns fewer than *N*
  results, or exceeds a max latency.
- **Golden queries**: the 3rd CSV column asserts a result must contain a given
  substring — an index-regression canary, checked even with global assertions off.

Failures are counted, badged (**FAIL** chip), logged, and written to the CSV.

## Metrics & monitoring

- **Latency percentiles** — p50 / p95 / p99.
- **Zero-result rate** — share of successful queries returning nothing.
- **Trends** — per-minute sparklines of average latency and success rate.
- **Persistence** — counters/trends saved to `<logdir>/metrics.json` every 30s
  and on shutdown, restored on startup.
- **`/healthz`** — JSON liveness (`status`, `version`, `uptime`, `running`).
- **`/metrics`** — Prometheus exposition format for Grafana/alerting, e.g.
  `timpicise_queries_total`, `timpicise_zero_results_total`,
  `timpicise_assert_failures_total`, `timpicise_latency_ms_p95`.

## Alerts

Thresholds evaluated over the last *N* queries: **error rate**, **zero-result
rate**, **assertion-failure rate**, **p95 latency**. On a breach the tool logs an
error, shows a dashboard banner, and (if a **webhook URL** is set) POSTs a
message — compatible with **Slack** (`text`), **Discord** (`content`), and generic
incoming webhooks. Edge-triggered with a cooldown; sends a recovery notice when
metrics return to normal.

## Logging

- **CSV results log** — `results.csv`: every query (time, mode, kind, query,
  status, count, latency, ok, assert, note, error, top title). Downloadable from
  the dashboard. Rotates at 10 MiB (rotation never truncates on a failed rename).
- **App log** — `timpicise.log`: structured lifecycle/error log (also to the
  terminal; `--verbose` for debug). Rotates at 10 MiB.
- Both live under a per-user **log folder** shown in the dashboard; each is
  toggleable.

## Safety & anti-abuse

- **Hard floor of 1 query / 60s** — compiled in (`config.MinPollSeconds`); the UI
  and config file cannot go below it.
- **One query at a time.** No concurrency, no burst. Randomized jitter.
- **Honest User-Agent** identifying the tool and its repo.
- **Backoff that honors `429`/`503`** and `Retry-After`.
- **Dry-run by default** — does nothing over the network until you opt in.
- **Loopback dashboard** — binds to `127.0.0.1` by default.
- **DNS-rebinding / CSRF guard** — rejects requests with a non-local `Host`
  header and cross-origin state-changing requests. Non-loopback bind requires
  `--expose`.
- **Endpoint URL validation** — only `http(s)` endpoints accepted.

## Accessibility

Skip link, visible keyboard focus states, ARIA roles/labels (`role=alert` /
`aria-live` for alerts and live results, scoped table headers, labelled charts),
colorblind-safe status glyphs (✓/✗, not color alone), and `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Build from source

Requires [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.26+.

```bash
go build -o timpicise ./cmd/timpicise   # current platform
go test ./...                           # run the tests
./build.sh                              # cross-compile every target into ./dist
```

The only third-party dependency is [`chromedp`](https://github.com/chromedp/chromedp)
(pure Go), used for browser mode; it drives an installed browser and bundles
nothing, so the single binary still cross-compiles everywhere.

`build.sh` produces binaries for Windows (amd64/arm64), Linux (amd64/arm64),
Raspberry Pi (armv7 32-bit, armv6 Pi Zero), and macOS (amd64/arm64).
